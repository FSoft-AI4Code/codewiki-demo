# Core Agent System

## Overview

The Core Agent System is the foundational module of OpenHands that provides the essential infrastructure for agent-based task execution. It serves as the central orchestration layer that manages agent lifecycle, state transitions, action parsing, and control flow mechanisms. This system enables autonomous agents to interact with various environments while maintaining proper state management and execution control.

## Purpose

The Core Agent System is designed to:

- **Agent Management**: Provide a unified interface for different agent implementations through the abstract Agent base class
- **State Management**: Maintain comprehensive execution state including iteration tracking, budget control, and conversation history
- **Action Processing**: Parse and validate agent responses into executable actions through sophisticated parsing mechanisms
- **Control Flow**: Implement traffic control and execution limits to ensure safe and bounded agent operations
- **Integration Foundation**: Serve as the integration point for LLM services, runtime environments, and other system components

## Architecture Overview

The Core Agent System follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Core Components

The Core Agent System is organized into three main sub-modules, each handling specific aspects of agent operation:

### 1. Agent Management
The agent management sub-module provides the foundational infrastructure for agent lifecycle and registration. It defines the abstract Agent base class that serves as the template for all agent implementations, manages agent discovery through a centralized registry, and handles integration with LLM services and tool systems.

**Key Features:**
- Abstract agent interface with standardized lifecycle methods
- Centralized agent registry for dynamic agent discovery
- Integrated LLM and prompt management
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool support

For detailed information, see [Agent Management](agent_management.md).

### 2. State Management
The state management sub-module maintains comprehensive execution state throughout agent operations. It tracks conversation history, manages control flags for iteration and budget limits, handles state persistence across sessions, and supports complex multi-agent delegation scenarios.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive state tracking with event history
- Sophisticated control flag system for execution limits
- Persistent state with save/restore capabilities
- Multi-agent delegation support with metrics tracking

For detailed information, see [State Management](state_management.md).

### 3. Action Processing
The action processing sub-module converts raw LLM responses into structured, executable actions. It implements a flexible parsing system that can handle multiple response formats, validates action parameters, and provides comprehensive error handling for malformed responses.

**Key Features:**
- Modular parser chain architecture
- Comprehensive response validation
- Extensible action type support
- Robust error handling and recovery

For detailed information, see [Action Processing](action_processing.md).

## System Integration
