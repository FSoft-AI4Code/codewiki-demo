# Aggregator Module Documentation

## Introduction

The Aggregator module is a core component of the ClickHouse database system responsible for executing aggregation operations. It provides high-performance, memory-efficient aggregation capabilities with support for distributed computing, external memory usage, and JIT compilation optimizations. The module handles complex GROUP BY operations, aggregate function computations, and manages memory resources during large-scale data processing.

## Architecture Overview

The Aggregator module implements a sophisticated multi-level aggregation architecture that adapts to data characteristics and system constraints. It supports various aggregation methods, from simple in-memory hash tables to complex two-level structures that can spill to disk when memory limits are exceeded.

    end
```

## Core Components

### CompiledAggregateFunctionsHolder

The `CompiledAggregateFunctionsHolder` is a critical component that manages JIT-compiled aggregate functions for performance optimization. It integrates with the embedded compiler system to provide compiled versions of aggregate functions when beneficial.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CompiledAggregateFunctionsHolder {
        -CompiledAggregateFunctions compiled_aggregate_functions
        +CompiledAggregateFunctionsHolder(compiled_function_)
        +~CompiledAggregateFunctionsHolder()
    }
    
    class CompiledExpressionCacheEntry {
        <<interface>>
    }
    
    class CHJIT {
        <<external>>
    }
    
    CompiledAggregateFunctionsHolder --|> CompiledExpressionCacheEntry
    CompiledAggregateFunctionsHolder --> CHJIT : uses
```

### Aggregator::Params

The `Params` structure encapsulates all configuration parameters for aggregation operations, including memory limits, thresholds, and optimization settings.

Key parameters include:
- **Memory Management**: `max_bytes_before_external_group_by`, `min_free_disk_space`
- **Performance Tuning**: `group_by_two_level_threshold`, `max_threads`, `enable_prefetch`
- **Compilation Control**: `compile_aggregate_expressions`, `min_count_to_compile_aggregate_expression`
- **Optimization**: `optimize_group_by_constant_keys`, `min_hit_rate_to_use_consecutive_keys_optimization`

### Aggregation Methods

The module implements multiple aggregation methods optimized for different data characteristics:

graph LR
    subgraph "Aggregation Method Selection"
        A[Data Analysis] --> B{Key Characteristics}
        B -->|Single Key| C[Key8/16/32/64]
        B -->|Multiple Keys| D[Keys128/256]
        B -->|Nullable Keys| E[Nullable Variants]
        B -->|Low Cardinality| F[LowCardinality Variants]
        B -->|Complex Types| G[Serialized Methods]
        
        H[Performance Requirements] --> I{Threshold Checks}
        I -->|High Cardinality| J[Two-Level Conversion]
        I -->|Memory Pressure| K[External Aggregation]
    end
```

        alt Memory limit exceeded
            A->>S: writeToTemporaryFile()
            S-->>A: Temporary file handle
        end
        
        alt Two-level threshold reached
            A->>A: convertToTwoLevel()
        end
    end
    
    Q->>A: convertToBlocks()

```

## Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Aggregation Methods

The module automatically selects the most efficient aggregation method based on:
- Key data types and sizes
- Cardinality estimates
- Nullable key presence
- Low cardinality optimization opportunities

### 2. Two-Level Aggregation

When data cardinality exceeds thresholds, the system converts to two-level hash tables:
- **First Level**: In-memory hash table with limited buckets
- **Second Level**: Disk-based storage for overflow data
- **Benefits**: Enables parallel processing and memory efficiency

### 3. External Aggregation

For large datasets exceeding memory limits:
- Automatic spilling to temporary files
- Compressed storage format
- Parallel merge operations
- Configurable disk space management

### 4. JIT Compilation

Performance optimization through runtime compilation:
- Compiles frequently used aggregate functions
- Reduces function call overhead
- Integrates with expression cache
- Configurable compilation thresholds

### 5. Memory Management

Sophisticated memory management including:
- Arena-based allocation for efficiency
- Memory usage tracking
- Configurable limits and thresholds
- Automatic cleanup and resource management
