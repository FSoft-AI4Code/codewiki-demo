# Unity ML-Agents Repository Overview

## Purpose

The Unity ML-Agents repository is a comprehensive machine learning framework that enables the creation, training, and deployment of intelligent agents within Unity environments. This toolkit bridges the gap between Unity's game engine capabilities and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, providing researchers, developers, and educators with a powerful platform for developing AI-driven applications, games, and simulations.

The repository serves multiple purposes:
- **Research Platform**: Enables academic and industrial research in reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and AI behavior
- **Game Development Tool**: Provides game developers with intelligent NPC behaviors and adaptive gameplay mechanics
- **Educational Resource**: Offers a hands-on learning environment for understanding machine learning concepts
- **Production Framework**: Supports deployment of trained AI models in commercial Unity applications

## End-to-End Architecture

The Unity ML-Agents framework follows a distributed architecture that separates the Unity runtime environment from the Python-based training infrastructure, connected through a robust communication layer.
