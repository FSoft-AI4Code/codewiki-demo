# Elastic Logstash Repository Overview

## Purpose

The `elastic--logstash` repository is the core implementation of Logstash, a powerful data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and sends it to various destinations. This repository contains the Java-based core engine that provides high-performance event processing, plugin management, and pipeline execution capabilities while maintaining seamless integration with Ruby-based plugins and configurations.

## End-to-End Architecture

The Logstash architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns across multiple layers:
