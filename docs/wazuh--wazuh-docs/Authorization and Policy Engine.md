# Authorization and Policy Engine

## Introduction

The Authorization and Policy Engine is a core component of the RBAC Security module responsible for managing access control to system resources. It provides the necessary tools to define and enforce security policies based on user roles and permissions. This module allows administrators to create a granular access control system, ensuring that users can only access the resources and perform the actions necessary for their roles.

## Architecture

The engine is built around three main concepts: Roles, Policies, and Rules.

*   **Roles**: Represent a set of permissions. Users are assigned to roles, and they inherit the permissions of those roles.
*   **Policies**: Define the permissions. A policy specifies what actions are allowed or denied on which resources.
*   **Rules**: Determine the conditions under which a role is assigned to a user. Rules are evaluated against the user's authorization context.

The main components of this module are:

*   `RBAChecker`: Evaluates the authorization context against the defined rules to determine which roles a user has.
*   `PreProcessor`: Optimizes the policies for efficient evaluation.
*   `RolesManager`, `PoliciesManager`, `RulesManager`: These ORM classes manage the persistence of roles, policies, and rules in the database.
