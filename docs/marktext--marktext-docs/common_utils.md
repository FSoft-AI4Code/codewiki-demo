# Common Utils Module Documentation

## Introduction

The `common_utils` module provides essential utility functions and path management services for the application. At its core, it manages environment paths and directory structures that are fundamental to the application's data storage, logging, and configuration management. This module serves as a centralized location for path resolution and environment setup, ensuring consistent file system operations across the entire application.

## Architecture Overview

The common_utils module is built around a single core component that provides path management capabilities:

### Core Component
- **EnvPaths**: A class that manages all application-specific directory paths including user data, logs, preferences, and data center paths

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Common Utils Module"
        EP[EnvPaths]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Core"
        AP[App]
        AE[AppEnvironment]
        APa[AppPaths]
        AC[Accessor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Management"
        DC[DataCenter]
        PR[Preference]
    end
    
    subgraph "File System"
        FW[Watcher]
    end

## Component Details

### EnvPaths Class

The `EnvPaths` class is the cornerstone of the common_utils module, providing a centralized path management system. It creates and manages all necessary directory paths for the application's operation.

#### Key Features
- **Centralized Path Management**: Consolidates all application paths in a single location
- **Automatic Directory Structure**: Creates organized directory hierarchies for different data types
- **Date-based Logging**: Automatically organizes log files by year and month
- **Validation**: Ensures required paths are provided and valid

#### Constructor Parameters
- `userDataPath` (string): The base user data path where all application data will be stored

#### Properties
- `electronUserDataPath`: Path for Electron-specific user data
- `userDataPath`: Base path for all user data
- `logPath`: Organized log path with year/month structure
- `preferencesPath`: Path for user preferences
- `dataCenterPath`: Path for data center operations
- `preferencesFilePath`: Full path to the preferences JSON file

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "EnvPaths Class"
        C[Constructor<br/>userDataPath]
        P1[electronUserDataPath]
        P2[userDataPath]
        P3[logPath]
        P4[preferencesPath]
        P5[dataCenterPath]
        P6[preferencesFilePath]
    end

    C -->|initializes| P5
    C -->|initializes| P6
    
    P3 -->|structure| Y[Year/Month<br/>Log Organization]
```

## Data Flow

The EnvPaths component follows a simple initialization and access pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as "Main Application"
    participant EP as "EnvPaths"
    participant FS as "File System"
    
    App->>EP: Create with userDataPath
    EP->>EP: Validate userDataPath
    EP->>EP: Initialize all path properties
    EP->>FS: Create directory structure
    
    Note over App,FS: Runtime Path Access
    App->>EP: Request specific path
    EP-->>App: Return computed path
    
    Note over App,FS: Common Requests
    App->>EP: get logPath
    EP-->>App: logs/20241 (example)
    App->>EP: get preferencesFilePath
    EP-->>App: preference.json path
```

## Integration with Other Modules

The common_utils module serves as a foundational service that other modules depend on for path resolution:

### Main Application Core
- **App**: Uses EnvPaths for determining where to store application data
- **AppEnvironment**: References paths for environment-specific configurations
- **AppPaths**: Integrates with EnvPaths for comprehensive path management
- **Accessor**: Uses paths for data access operations

### Data Management
- **DataCenter**: Relies on EnvPaths for data storage locations
- **Preference**: Uses EnvPaths to locate the preferences file

### File System
- **Watcher**: Monitors directories whose paths are provided by EnvPaths

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Common Utils"
        ENV[EnvPaths]
    end
    
    subgraph "Main App Core"
        APP[App]
        ENV_APP[AppEnvironment]
        PATHS[AppPaths]
        ACC[Accessor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
        DC[DataCenter]
        PREF[Preference]
    end
    
    subgraph "File System Layer"
        WATCH[Watcher]
    end
    
    ENV -.->|provides paths| APP
    ENV -.->|provides paths| ENV_APP
    ENV -.->|provides paths| PATHS
    ENV -.->|provides paths| ACC
    ENV -.->|provides paths| DC
    ENV -.->|provides paths| PREF
    ENV -.->|provides paths| WATCH
    
    style ENV fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

## Usage Patterns

### Initialization
The EnvPaths class is typically instantiated during application startup with the user data path provided by the Electron framework:

```javascript
// Example usage pattern
const userDataPath = app.getPath('userData');
const envPaths = new EnvPaths(userDataPath);
```

### Path Access
Once initialized, other components can access specific paths as needed:

```javascript
// Accessing different paths
const logPath = envPaths.logPath;
const preferencesPath = envPaths.preferencesFilePath;
const dataCenterPath = envPaths.dataCenterPath;
```

## Error Handling

The EnvPaths class implements basic validation:
- Throws an error if `userDataPath` is not provided during construction
- Ensures all paths are properly constructed using Node.js path utilities

## Future Considerations

The code includes commented sections indicating planned features:
- Global storage path management
- Session path management
- Enhanced preferences path organization

These features are marked with TODO comments and may be implemented in future versions.

## Dependencies

The EnvPaths class has minimal external dependencies:
- **Node.js path module**: Used for cross-platform path construction
- **Date object**: Used for organizing log files by date

This minimal dependency footprint makes the common_utils module highly reliable and easy to maintain.
