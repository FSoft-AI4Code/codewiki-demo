# Backend Server Module Documentation

## Overview

The `backend_server` module is the core execution engine of StarRocks, responsible for distributed query processing, data storage operations, and runtime management. It serves as the computational backbone that executes query plans, manages data ingestion, and coordinates with the storage engine to provide high-performance analytical processing capabilities.

## Purpose

The backend server module provides:
- **Query Execution**: Distributed execution of query fragments with vectorized processing
- **Data Storage**: Columnar storage management with compression and indexing
- **Runtime Coordination**: Fragment lifecycle management and inter-node communication
- **Expression Evaluation**: Comprehensive SQL expression processing with JIT compilation
- **File System Abstraction**: Unified interface for local and cloud storage systems
- **Data Format Support**: Native support for Parquet, ORC, and other analytical formats
- **User-Defined Functions**: Multi-language UDF support (Java, Python)
- **Performance Optimization**: Runtime filters, caching, and adaptive execution
