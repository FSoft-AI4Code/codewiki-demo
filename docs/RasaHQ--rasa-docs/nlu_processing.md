# NLU Processing Module

## Overview

The NLU (Natural Language Understanding) Processing module is a core component of the Rasa framework responsible for extracting meaning and structure from user messages. This module transforms raw text into structured data that can be understood by the dialogue management system, enabling conversational AI applications to comprehend user intent and extract relevant entities.

## Purpose and Core Functionality

The NLU Processing module serves as the intelligence layer that bridges human language and machine understanding. It performs three primary functions:

1. **Intent Classification**: Determines what the user wants to achieve with their message
2. **Entity Extraction**: Identifies and extracts specific pieces of information from the text
3. **Feature Engineering**: Converts text into numerical representations that machine learning models can process

## Architecture Overview

```

The module follows a pipeline architecture where text flows through sequential processing stages:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaks text into meaningful units (tokens)
2. **Featurization**: Converts tokens into numerical features
3. **Classification/Extraction**: Applies machine learning models to extract intents and entities
4. **Post-processing**: Applies business logic and confidence thresholds
